### Hey, I'm Sothatsit, A.K.A. Paddy Lamont

I've always enjoyed programming things, and so this is where I dump some of my more complete projects.

### A sample of the projects I have on here are:

- 🎲 The Royal Game of Ur, [Client](https://github.com/Sothatsit/RoyalUrClient "Royal Ur Client") and [Server](https://github.com/Sothatsit/RoyalUrServer "Royal Ur Server") -
An ancient board game implemented for the web, play at https://royalur.net/.

- 🔊 [AudioStream](https://github.com/Sothatsit/AudioStream) - Allows streaming of audio between computers, or to multiple outputs (play to many bluetooth headphones!).

- 📏 [Evaluate](https://github.com/Sothatsit/Evaluate "Evaluate") - Parse, optimise, compile and evaluate arbitrary mathematical expressions in Java, all at runtime.

- 📋 [Bake](https://github.com/Sothatsit/Bake) - Implements a subset of the features of [make](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/make.1.html), written in C.

- ♞ [ThreePlayerChess](https://github.com/Sothatsit/ThreePlayerChess) - Implements an AI agent to play the game of three-player chess.
